This is also aligned with the Maltese Government’s strategy in tapping the potential of the Mediterranean region. The Maltese Government has been an active player in the creation of the Euro Mediterranean Gas platform and has been on the forefront in raising the profile of the Mediterranean. Malta is often seen as an honest broker in this regard thanks to historically good links with its Mediterranean neighbors.”
<p>New Silkroutes also announced the change of ownership of New Silkroutes Group (Europe) Limited from International Energy Group Pte Ltd (“IEGPL”) to the Group.

We look forward to a stronger, more engaging company where significant synergies are created on the back of the combined strengths of our shareholders.  The (share) transfers at New Silkroutes Group (Europe) Limited and IEG fit our strategy for growth as we develop new markets and products for our shareholders. It will help facilitate oil and gas trading and investment in oil storage infrastructure, and help the company realize its aim to establish itself as the industry leader.”
<p>Dr Goh concluded, “We are on track in collaborating with the government of Malta to develop the Republic as the price discovery center for energy in the EU and the Mediterranean.  In our transformation, we have focused on setting the pace for IEG to be the leading oil and gas player on the Euro-Asian arena.  The collaboration with the Malta government is timely, given that we can now capitalize on the recently concluded EU-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (EUSFTA).’’
